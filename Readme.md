# Haskell-Socket.io

Implementation of the socket.io protocol in haskell

## Current status

So far only the parser have been implemented.
This is my weekend project to learn Haskell, so progress will be extremely slow.

## Tests

The original [socket.io](https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io) tests are being ported to `HUnit`.
To run them just type in your terminal:

    make
